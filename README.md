## Installation
Once you have cloned the repository, you need version 4.0.0 of node and upwards. check your node version with the following command:
```bash
$ node --version
```
If you have an older version of node, or don't have not at all, you can install it by going to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Once node is installed, three commands should be run
To get the application ready for execution, run the following two commands:
```javascript
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp
$ gulp compile
```
NOTE:  Tested using node v5.8.0

Once those have completed, you can now start up a server:
```javascript
$ npm start
```

Once the server executable is running, just browse to **http://localhost:3000** to see it in action.  Videos on usage to be posted on youtube shortly.
