## Usage
To get the application ready for execution, you must have nodeJS installed on your machine and then following commands:
```javascript
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp
$ gulp
```
NOTE:  Tested using node v5.8.0

Once those have completed, you can now start up a server:
```javascript
$ npm start
```

Once the server executable is running, just browse to **http://localhost:3000** to see it in action.  Videos on usage to be posted on youtube shortly.
